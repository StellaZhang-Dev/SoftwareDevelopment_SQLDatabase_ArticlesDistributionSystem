# Articles Distribution System

## Overview

Articles Distribution System is a manuscript management system developed using ASP.NET MVC. This system aims to streamline the manuscript submission and review process, reducing time and effort for both authors and publishers. It allows authors to submit their articles online, track their submission status, and receive notifications upon acceptance. Editors can efficiently manage submissions, review manuscripts, and approve content for publication.

This project was originally developed as an academic thesis project over a decade ago, using **Visual Studio 2010** and **SQL Server 2005**, with C# as the primary programming language. Over the years, it has undergone multiple minor modifications to improve compatibility with modern environments, including optimizations for macOS.

The system follows a structured and modular development approach, integrating essential components such as user authentication, role-based access control, article management, and administrative tools.

## Features

The system provides four main functional areas:

1. **User Management**
   - User registration and authentication
   - Role-based access control (Admin, Editor, Author)
   - Password recovery via email

2. **Manuscript Submission and Review**
   - Online article submission
   - Real-time tracking of submission status
   - Editorial review process
   - Approval and rejection management

3. **Content Management**
   - Article categorization
   - Search and filter functionalities
   - Secure storage of articles

4. **Communication & Notifications**
   - Internal messaging system
   - Email notifications for submission updates
   - Interactive commenting on articles

## System Architecture

The system is structured into the following components:

- **Controllers**: Manages requests and responses.
- **Models**: Defines data structures and business logic.
- **Views**: Provides the user interface for interaction.
- **Database**: Stores user data, article submissions, and system configurations.
